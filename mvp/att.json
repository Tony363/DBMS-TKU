If the company fails to contain program costs, it could lead to reduction in the order size for F-35 aircraft. In June 2014, F-35A experienced a fire in the engine during takeoff on a training flight at Eglin Air Force Base. Besides, the F-35s have been grounded twice in 2013 after different parts failed. For instance, in February 2013, the entire F-35 Lightning II fleet was grounded after the discovery of a cracked engine blade in one aircraft. The US Air Force technicians detected a 0.6-inch crack on a third stage turbine blade, while performing a routine periodical inspection of the F-135 engine on AF-2 test aircraft operating at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The crack resulted from stressful operating environment experienced in test flights. As a precautionary measure, the engine inspections time was reduced from usual 50 flight hours to 25 flight hours. The cost of producing F-35 gone up as the US government modified their contact with Lockheed Martin to purchase 2,400 F-35 with the delivery of 60 F-35 per year till 2044 instead of buying 80 planes per year till 2038.

The US Air Force technicians detected a 0.6-inch crack on a third stage turbine blade, while performing a routine periodical inspection of the F-135 engine on AF-2 test aircraft operating at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The crack resulted from stressful operating environment experienced in test flights. As a precautionary measure, the engine inspections time was reduced from usual 50 flight hours to 25 flight hours. The cost of producing F-35 gone up as the US government modified their contact with Lockheed Martin to purchase 2,400 F-35 with the delivery of 60 F-35 per year till 2044 instead of buying 80 planes per year till 2038.
